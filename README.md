# Containers demo

The idea is to illustrate the power of containers in the context of CSPA services.

# Components

A RabbitMQ broker, the dump pipes

A Python UI/rest, the triangles services

A Java service, consuming triangles and producing squares

A Javascript service, a CSPA service we want to integrate

All of them are Docker containers

# Questions

Should we stay on an abstract level or should we use more "statistical" services ?
